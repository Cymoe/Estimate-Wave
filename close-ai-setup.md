   understanding their challenges. Never mention you're AI.
   ```

### Step 3: Create Conversation Flows

**Initial Greeting Flow:**
```
AI: "Hey! Thanks for reaching out to Estimate Wave. I help contractors dominate 
their local market. What type of work do you specialize in?"

[trade] contractors in [their area]."
```

### Step 4: Instagram Integration

Since Instagram is your money channel:

   - ManyChat captures it
   - Zapier creates lead in Close
   - Bland AI can follow up via SMS

### Step 5: SMS/WhatsApp Setup

1. Get a Twilio number ($1/month + usage)
2. Connect Twilio to Bland AI
3. Update your website with the Twilio number
4. All texts go through AI first, then to you if qualified

### Step 6: Website Implementation

Update your chat modal:
```javascript
// Add tracking for Close CRM
function openChatModal() {
    // Track in Close via API
    fetch('https://api.close.com/api/v1/activity/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Basic YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            lead_id: 'YOUR_LEAD_ID',
            type: 'ChatModalOpened',
            source: 'Website'
        })
    });
    
    // Open modal
    document.getElementById('chatModal').classList.add('active');
}
```

### Step 7: The Complete Flow

1. **Visitor clicks "Start a Conversation"**
2. **Chooses channel** (Instagram/SMS/WhatsApp)
3. **AI responds** within 30 seconds
4. **AI qualifies** them with natural conversation
5. **If qualified**, AI says: "This sounds like a great fit! Myles will personally reach out within the next few minutes to discuss your specific situation."
6. **You get notified** in Close with full context
7. **You close the deal** with a warm, qualified lead

### Step 8: AI Training Data

Feed your AI these successful conversation examples:

**Good Lead Example:**
```
Lead: "I need help getting more high-end kitchen remodel jobs"
AI: "Kitchen remodels are great for building reputation! What's your average project size right now?"
Lead: "Usually around $30-40k"
AI: "Perfect, we specialize in helping contractors like you attract $50k+ kitchen projects. How many leads are you getting monthly?"
Lead: "Maybe 2-3, but half are tire kickers"
AI: "That's exactly what we fix. Myles has helped similar contractors get 10-15 pre-qualified leads who already know your pricing. He'll reach out in the next 5 minutes to share exactly how we'd do this for you."
